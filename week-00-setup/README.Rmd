# Week 00: Getting Started

This is a preliminary week to guide you through the steps needed to get going
with R/RStudio on your DfE laptop. If you've already done this you can feel
free to skip this - although it might be a good idea to check your installations
are up to date if you haven't used the software for a few months. 

# Installing R/RStudio

R and RStudio are distinct pieces of software. R is the language, while RStudio
is an *Integrated Development Environment* or *IDE* which is designed to work
very well with R, although it has some support for other languages. There are
other IDEs available, and it is even possible to run R from your machine console
without using an IDE at all. However, RStudio is the most widely used platform
for R for very good reasons, and we strongly recommend you start there.

## Download from the Software Centre

To download R and RStudio, simply open the Software Centre (this should be an
existing app on your PC) and download from there. If for any reason you can't
see R or RStudio available, you'll need to make a 
[service request](https://dfe.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_category&catalog_id=-1)
to get access to the software.

# Navigating RStudio

Note: This section is lifted from 
[Using R in the ESFA](https://rsconnect/rsc/esfa-r-training/). For more tips on 
how to make the most of RStudio see the 
[RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

## RStudio Layout
When opening RStudio for the first time, you should see something like this:
![RStudio Window](week-00-setup/rstudio-layout.PNG)

**TOP LEFT**

* Source - This is the pane you may not see on initial opening. This is where you work on files.

**TOP RIGHT**

* Environment - This is where you can see objects in the loadspace (functions, dataframes etc.).
* History - A record of any commands you have used
* Connections - Any connections to SQL databases you have made.

**BOTTOM LEFT**

* Console - This is where you enter your R code.
* Terminal - This is where you can enter secure shell commands.

**BOTTOM RIGHT**

* Files - Any files in your current working directory.
* Plots - Any graphs you make in 'Console' appear here.
* Packages - Any packages you have installed to R.
* Help - Support on any package/function you don't understand. A place without judgement.
* Viewer - A place for viewing local web content.

# Running Code
Running code means telling RStudio to carry out the actions you have specified
in your script. 'Run Selected Line(s)' under 'Code' runs any lines your cursor
highlights. There is also a button on the 'Source' pane titled 'Run' that does
this and the shortcut (CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER). There are many options for running
different chunks of code under 'Run Region' under 'Code':

* Run from beginning to line - If your cursor was on line 17, it would run to that line inclusive (CTRL + ALT + B).
* Run from line to end - If your cursor was on line 17, it would run from that line to the end.
* Run function definition - If your cursor is on a function, it runs that function (CTRL + ALT + F).
* Run code section - R runs the section your cursor is currently within (CTRL + ALT + T).
* Run All - Runs the whole document (CTRL + ALT + R).
Code that is run appears in the 'Console' pane and any variables created in the 'Environment' pane.

# Changing the Theme
The default RStudio theme is very white and a bit blinding, but there are lots
of alternative themes available which are a bit easier on the eyes. Go to
'Tools' -> 'Global Options' -> 'Appearance' to change the theme. My favourite is
'Cobalt' :)

# Installing Packages

Packages are the mechanism by which users can extend R and make the features they
add available to others. Certain packages are extremely widely used, so it's good
to know how to download them. Try installing `dplyr` by running the following in
your RStudio console
```
install.packages("dplyr")
```

If this went okay you may want to install the whole `tidyverse` - this is a suite
of packages that is very widely used, so installing it now will probably save
you time later (though it takes a few minutes):
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

**Note:** As a general rule you should never include `install.packages()` in an
R *script*. This is so that others (including future you) who run your code don't 
accidentally end up changing the software on their own PC, which could have 
unintended consequences. If you want to install a package, do so from the console
(the bottom-left window), not from the 'source' (top-left) window.
