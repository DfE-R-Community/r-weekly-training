# Instructions If Submitting Solutions

If you're submitting solutions to a problem sheet, please first:

-   Make sure you haven't altered any other files in the repo! Changes should 
    be limited to your own solution scripts. If you've made any other changes 
    for a good reason (e.g. fixing typos/errors) then please explain this in 
    the pull request description. Better yet - make a separate pull request for 
    these changes :) You can check which files you've changed by looking in the 
    'Files' tab at the top of this page on Azure DevOps.

-   Make sure your code can be run from start to finish with no errors. The 
    easiest way to do this is to use `Shift + Ctrl + F10` to in RStudio to 
    restart your R session, then run your entire script and see if something 
    breaks.

-   Make your code beautiful! Seriously - writing code that is nice to read is 
    not easy, so take some time polishing your script to make it as clear as 
    possible. The [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) is a 
    good place to look for help with this.

-   Replace this text with your own description, add whoever is providing
    feedback as a required reviewer, then you should be good to submit :)
