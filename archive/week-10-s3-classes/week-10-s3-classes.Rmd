# Week 10: S3 Classes

Introduce S3 classes and how these can be used to help with bigger/more complex
programming tasks. Not completely sure if this chapter is needed or not... But
I think you can get a lot of easy-wins with these concepts. E.g.
```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

my_cars <- as_tibble(mtcars)
class(my_cars) <- c("my_tibble", class(my_cars))

print.my_tibble <- function(x, ...) {
  cat("A data.frame with the following column summaries:\n\n")
  print(summary(x))
  invisible(x)
}

my_cars
```
