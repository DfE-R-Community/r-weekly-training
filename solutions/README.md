# Usage
Still not completely sure how this folder should be used. Obviously, it's
probably not desirable to have solutions so easily available while people are
working on problems, although I think it's fine, even desirable, for people to
be able to snoop each other's pull requests. I think, once we start moving
solutions to this folder, we move them in batches at the end of each week. If 
we want to rerun the programme in later years we can probably just delete this
folder... Although it'll still be in the git history? Needs more thought.
