# Week 03: Base R

# A note on style

Much has been made (e.g. [here](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) and [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/12/why-i-dont-use-the-tidyverse/)) over the relative merits of the 'tidyverse' versus 'base R', particularly when it comes to learning R. Here we briefly outline the reasons for the debate and the view we have taken when creating this training programme.

-   **What is the tidyverse?** The tidyverse is a suite of R packages commonly used for data analysis. These are principally authored and maintained by RStudio/Hadley Wickham, and include `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tibble`, `purrr`, `stringr`, `forcats`and `readr`. Additionally, there is something of a 'tidy' brand, including a [code style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and a notion of ['tidy data'](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#tidy-data-1).
-   **What is base R?** Similarly, 'base R' is a a collection of packages which form part of the R source code. These include `base`, `datasets`, `utils`, `grDevices`, `graphics`, `stats`and `methods`. These are packages which come pre-packaged with R, so, e.g. you don't need to use `libarary(utils)` before using the `head()` function.

Here are some of the main arguments for and against base R/the tidyverse:

| Tidyverse | -   Packages in the tidyverse have been written to work well with each other and the pipe `%>%`. This has given rise to something of an ecosystem, with one benefit being that a little bit of learning tends to go a long way. | -   The tidyverse is unashamedly '[opinionated](https://www.tidyverse.org/)' about how you should write code and think about data analysis. This can be a good thing, but you may find it less flexible than other approaches for some applications.                                     |

|           | -   Many tidyverse packages are just *very good*, particularly `ggplot2` and `dplyr`                                                                                                                                            | -   As tidyverse packages are not bundled with R, you may find you run into issues with reproducibility, especially if working on the same project over a long period of time (although [there are ways](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) of dealing with this issue). |

|           | -   The developers of base packages strive for backward-compatibility, meaning that code written in base is much more likely to 'just work' in 5 years than code that depends on external packages                              | -   Compared to many tidyverse functions, many base functions have surprising quirks, in part because of base's devotion to backward-compatibility                                                                                                                                       |

|           | -   Tidyverse code is sometimes criticised as being less 'R-like' than base. If initally you only use base, you are likely to get a better feel for R as a language in your first few weeks of coding.                          | -   Base code is often harder to read. This is partially due to the fact that most base functions have not been written to play nicely with the (base) pipe `|>`.                                                                                                                        |

For this course, we have chosen to primarily teach the tidyverse way of doing things. The primary reason for this is that in a business context where collaboration is paramount, having uniformity in the way we do things makes the work we do easier for everyone involved, and this is something the tidyverse provides really well. However, this is not to say that the 'tidy' approach is always better; on the contrary, you may often find that base is preferable for the reasons given above, and in such cases you should use your best judgement. However, for the purposes of this course, we encourage use of the tidyverse where possible, and we especially encourage you to follow the tidyverse style guide.

## Exercises

Stuff to compare tidyverse and base. Also introduce important base syntax, e.g. the use of `$`, `[`, `[[`, `{`, `...` etc.
