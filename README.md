# R Weekly Training

Welcome to the DfE R Community's R Weekly Training! This programme
should get you up-to-speed with the basics of R. This programme is run
annually over a 3(ish)-month period, so if you're interested in
participating but aren't sure when the next round will be, [get in
touch](mailto:jacob.scott@education.gov.uk) ðŸ™‚

# Scope

The primary goal of this programme is simply to enable inexperienced R
users to get feedback on their code, whilst also providing something of
a learning-pathway to a well-rounded knowledge of the language. For this
reason we have generally only provided exercises for a given topic,
along with external resources that users should refer to when attempting
them. This helps keep the programme focussed while also introducing some
of the habits of self-directed learning which are essential for any R
user.

# Get Started

Each week has its own subdirectory in this repo. The exercises for each
week are given in the `README.md` file for that week, meaning they
should be nicely rendered when viewed online in GitHub (or Azure
DevOps). These folders may also contain other resources, e.g. datasets,
to make use of when completing the exercises. To get started, go to
[Week
01](https://dfe-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/Training-Repositories/_git/R-Weekly-Training?path=/week-01-getting-started&version=GBmain&_a=contents).

    problem
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great, free
    e-book by Hadley Wickham, from which this programme liberally
    borrows
-   [RStudio
    Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#) are a
    great way to quickly brush-up on specific R packages
