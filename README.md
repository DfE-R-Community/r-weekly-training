# R Weekly Training

Welcome to ESFA Data Science's weekly R training! This programme should get you up-to-speed with the basics of R. We're planning to run this programme across a period of 3-4 months, possibly on an annual basis, so if you're interested in participating but aren't sure when the next round will be, [get in touch](mailto:jacob.scott@education.gov.uk) :)

# Scope

The primary goal of this programme is simply to enable inexperienced R users to get feedback on their code, whilst also providing something of a learning-pathway to a well-rounded knowledge of the language. For this reason we have generally only provided exercises for a given topic, along with external resources that users should refer to when attempting them. This helps keep the programme focussed while also introducing some of the habits of self-directed learning which are essential for any R user.

# Get Started

Each week has its own subdirectory in this repo. The exercises for each week are given in the `README.md` file for that week, meaning they should be nicely rendered when viewed online in Azure DevOps. These folders may also contain other resources, e.g. datasets, to make use of when completing the exercises. To get started, go to [Week 01](https://dfe-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/Training-Repositories/_git/R-Weekly-Training?path=/week-01-getting-started&version=GBmain&_a=contents).

# Some things we'll cover:

-   Data wrangling using [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
-   Data visualisation using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
-   Text manipulation using regular expressions and [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)
-   Functional programming using [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)
-   App/dashboard development using [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
-   The basics report generation using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
-   Good coding practice using the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
-   The basics of version control using Git and Azure DevOps

# Resources:

-   The DfE R Community [Training Support](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a1c926bdbecf94b8b8d7e303670f98bc2%40thread.skype/Training%2520Support?groupId=b95c605d-8fbc-4e4d-9a76-2f7d1c55e70a&tenantId=fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9) channel is a good place to ask for help if you get stuck on a problem
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great, free e-book by Hadley Wickham, from which this programme liberally borrows
-   [Using R in the ESFA](https://rsconnect/rsc/esfa-r-training/#) is another e-book by colleagues within the ESFA to introduce R as it is used within the agency
-   You might find a more interactive approach suits you better. If so, check out [The Analytics Academy](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DAN/Data%20Science/The%20Analytics%20Academy%20-%20An%20R%20training%20course.aspx), another great resource maintained by the DfE
-   [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#) are a great way to quickly brush-up on specific R packages
