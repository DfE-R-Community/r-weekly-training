# R Weekly Training

> **Warning** This repo is currently undergoing a rewrite. Please wait
until this warning disappears before using the materials herein.

Welcome to the DfE R Community's R Weekly Training! This programme
should get you up-to-speed with the basics of R. This programme is run
annually over a 3(ish)-month period, so if you're interested in
participating but aren't sure when the next round will be, [get in
touch](mailto:jacob.scott@education.gov.uk) ðŸ™‚

# Scope

What this programme *is*:

-   A collection of questions, broken down by topic, with links to good
    resources to help you complete them

-   A way of learning by *doing*, with an emphasis on doing your own
    research and getting review from other colleagues

What this programme *isn't*:

-   A detailed guide on how to use R, RStudio or R packages

The programme has been designed this way because maintaining learning
materials requires a sustained focus which most organisations don't have
resource for. As a result, organisation-internal learning materials tend
to become obsolete as the organisation moves on to new and better ways
of doing things, or, if the organisation doesn't move on, they hold them
back from adopting better ways of working. For this reason, this
programme simply aims to point you to resources which are widely used
and frequently updated, encouraging you to develop the habits you need
to stay abreast of changes to technologies and best practice. In other
words, while other programmes may give you a fish, this programme aims
to give you a fishing pole, and to point you to the lake.

# Get Started

Each week has its own subdirectory in this repo. The exercises for each
week are given in the `README.md` file for that week, meaning they
should be nicely rendered when viewed online in GitHub (or Azure
DevOps). These folders may also contain other resources, e.g. datasets,
to make use of when completing the exercises. To get started, go to
[Week
01](https://dfe-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/Training-Repositories/_git/R-Weekly-Training?path=/week-01-getting-started&version=GBmain&_a=contents).

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great, free
    e-book by Hadley Wickham, from which this programme liberally
    borrows
-   [RStudio
    Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#) are a
